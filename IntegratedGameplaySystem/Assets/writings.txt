project ethos:
the code yaps with eachother via scriptable object inspector references.
or via some other bullshit.
i am currently consideringmaking interactor a speerate behaviour
that has static references to the plots and such. lets try that on a different branch.

next todos:
 . add more stuff
 . make raycasting work --> #SOLID !!.

i think it would be cool to have like gameintioat type beat.
so there is basically only one gameobject in the scene which is a prefab with one thing in it.

convert to neweer unity because of the order of shit.
